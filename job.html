<h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
<p><b>Angus:</b> UX Designer</p>
<p><b>Jess:</b> Front End Developer</p>
<p><b>Asher:</b> Full Stack Developer</p>
<p>All three of our ideal jobs are in the field of IT. Jess and Asherâ€™s share significant overlap except as Asher wishes to become a full-stack developer will need to learn an entirely separate skill set and a number of programming languages. While Jess and Asher will focus primarily on technical programming skills for their jobs, UX designers will need analytical skills to research and understand the needs of customers. Some technical overlap that UX designers may share with front end developing may include HTML and CSS. Full-stack developers are highly sought as their skills give them flexibility to meet any needs of a prospective employer. While front end developers develop client software, full-stack are able to work on both the front end (client-side) and back end (server-side). Some back end programming languages include Python, Java, PHP, C #, C++ and SQL.
