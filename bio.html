<p>I am 21, my parents are Viet and I have a younger brother. I played a lot of League in high school but now don’t have much interest in games nowadays. Cricket was my main sport throughout school although I also played footy, futsal, basketball, badminton, and netball at a competitive level. My hobbies of late include watching anime and going to techno events/ doofs. My interest in IT mostly stems from the fact that I’m always on some sort of device nowadays. I enjoy reading news about new technology and innovation and it serves as an inspiration to one day hopefully do the same. Thinking practically, IT is a sector with a lot of job growth and I want to have some sort of security as I get older. I don’t have any professional experience in IT but through my course, I have learned a brief overview of things that include python, web design, UI/UX design, and business fundamentals.

<p>I am 24 and currently working as a nurse in an aged care facility. Before I became a nurse, I studied an Associate degree in Fashion Technology at RMIT. Throughout my teenage years I was never interested in school which led me to drop out in year 10.
        The years I spent out of high school really gave me time to think about who and what I wanted to be. I have a dog, 2 cats and a rabbit, they are my children. My hobbies outside of studying and videogames include; patternmaking, sewing and pole dancing. My interest in IT began when I was a young child. I grew up watching my older brothers play computer games on our family computer. My grandfather built computers as a hobby and built me my very first personal computer when I was 7. My only real experience with computers is just always having one that I could use all the time. I’ve gone through about 4 personal computers in my lifetime but I still don’t know how to build them or how they really work (which is why I'm in IT now).

<p>I am 24, as my name suggests I am of English decent, with nothing really besides that to note of. Technologically speaking, I have tried my hand in many different avenues of multimedia to some degree, ranging from brief stints with film projects, flash animation, machinima and art, to ongoing hobbies I regularly pour hours into today such as music, sound design, game design, coding, and crafts.  My hobbies are limited to working on the aforementioned or discovering new information/films/music/technology. I’ve spent a lot of time delving into the shallow end of most forms of media, but besides game creation I have yet to really commit or become experienced in any mediums, which I am now focusing on changing. My current interest in IT is broad but I find myself interested in programming to do with creating and constructing websites, games, apps, and back end systems.
